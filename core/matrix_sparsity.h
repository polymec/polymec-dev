// A matrix sparsity object represents the non-zero structure of a sparse 
// matrix, including distributed matrices that are partitioned into 
// contiguous sets of rows stored on several MPI processes. This data 
// structure is similar in nature to an adjacency graph (adj_graph), but 
// is defined in terms of a global index space spanning all MPI processes, 
// instead of a separate local index space for each process.
