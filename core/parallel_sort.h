// This function sorts an array whose data is distributed across the given 
// MPI communicator, using an odd-even transposition sort. 
// array pointed to by base, each having a (locally-stored) number of elements 
// The comparator comp is used to perform comparisons between local elements 
// in each array. On output, base points to the same locally-stored array as 
// before, but its data has been sorted on each process p such that processes 
// preceding p contain sorted data preceding that on p, and processes 
// following p contain sorted data following that on p.
