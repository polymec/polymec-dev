// This subsystem allows applications to define systems of units, and 
// associate with each system a set of physical constants. Automatic 
// conversions are provided between any two system of units for all common
// physical constants.

// Names of unit systems and constants are non-negative integers. They can 
// also be enumerated types (which can be converted to integers in C).
//
// Support is also offered for a globally-adopted, or "default" system of 
// units. By default, there is no valid system of units.

// Define a new system of units using the given label.
