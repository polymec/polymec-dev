// Given a global point cloud and a neighbor pairing connecting its points on 
// rank 0, this function partitions the points onto the processes on the given 
// communicator, replacing the point cloud and the stencil on each process 
// with the newly partitioned data. Each point can have a weight alloted to 
// it that characterizes its workload, and the load will be balanced within
// the given imbalance tolerance. A migrator capable of distributing data 
// to the partitions is returned.
// NOTE: partitioning of point clouds using stencils instead of neighbor 
// NOTE: pairings is NOT supported, since stencils generally represent 
// NOTE: asymmetric neighbor relations, which produce directed graphs, and 
// NOTE: our graph partitioning algorithms all operate on undirected graphs.
