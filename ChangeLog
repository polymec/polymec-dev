    * polymec: version 2.5.0
    * New distributed mesh type: blockmesh
      - This is an EXPERIMENTAL multi-block structured mesh. It passes basic
        smoke tests, but hasn't been fully verified yet.
      - Blockmesh fields are available on all centerings relevant to unimeshes.
    * Build/configure system enhancements
      - Added support for Ninja to the build system.
      - Added support for parallel unit testing to the build system.
      - Added various optimizations to speed up builds.
    * Field enhancements
      - Fields now have metadata objects that store information about physical
        considerations, scalars, vectors, tensors.
      - Exchangers can now aggregate values from multiple sources and reduce
        them using MPI's operators.
      - Implemented field exchanges for the colmesh on all centerings.
      - Implemented field exchanges for edge-centered polymesh fields.
    * Other parallelism enhancements
      - Added a blob_exchanger for exchanging variable-sized binary objects.
        (Not for use in environments with heterogeneous CPUs, at least not those
        with mixed endian-ness)
    * Interpreter enhancements
      - sp_func and st_func objects can now be implemented in Lua.
      - Improved support for Lua-implemented models and probes.
      - Added a dl module for dynamic library loading configuration.
    * Other features
      - Added log_flush, which writes data to a log synchronously.
      - Loggers no longer close system file descriptors.
      - Dynamic load libraries are now sought in the installation path by
        default.
      - xxx_verify_yyy() functions have been replaced with xxx_is_valid()
        functions that return internal strings explaining issues, instead of
        relying on handler functions.
    * Maintenance and tech debt
      - Bumped third-party libraries to their latest versions, with the
        exception of Sundials 4.1, which requires a rewrite of the solvers
        library.
      - Added a thirdparty Lua module that contains information about our
        third-party libraries. This module replaces the older 3rdparty.cfg file.
      - Removed the Fortran special functions library.
      - Removed unused code from the model library.
      - Travis CI builds are now much faster (they use a polymec-specific Docker
        image, and tests run in parallel).
      - Countless bugfixes, and a lot of cleanup.
