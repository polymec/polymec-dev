// This function creates a mesh consisting of 5 blocks of hexahedral 
// cells in the shape of a cylinder. The parameters of interest are:
// nx - The number of cells across a given block in the x-y plane.
// nz - The number of cells across a given block in the axial direction.
// R - The radius of the cylinder being represented.
// L - The length of the cylinder along the z axis.
// l - The length on a side of the center block of the cylinder. This must 
//     be less than R.
// curved_center_block - If set to true, the center block is curved into a 
//                       circle. If not, it is kept as a square.
// The following tags are used to designate surfaces of interest:
// R_tag      - the set of faces along the radius of the cylinder.
// bottom_tag - the set of faces along the bottom of the cylinder.
// top_tag    - the set of faces along the top of the cylinder.
