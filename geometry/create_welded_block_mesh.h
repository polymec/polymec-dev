// Given an array of logically-rectangular meshes (blocks) with boundary 
// (face) tags, this function welds together the meshes, identifying faces 
// with identical tags, to produce a single block-structured mesh containing 
// all of the cells, but only the nodes, edges, and faces that belong to the 
// intersection of the meshes. The nodal coordinates and mesh geometry of the 
// resulting mesh are the same as those of the input meshes. If two blocks 
// share a boundary tag but one of their faces or nodes is unmatched by another 
// within a distance given by the weld tolerance, this function fails fatally.
